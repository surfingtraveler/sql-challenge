This is an analysis to conduct a research project as assigned about people Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980's and 1990's.  To conduct the analysis the steps taken are as follows:

Step 1 - Data Modeling:  An entity Relationship Diagram was created using quickdatabasediagrams.com.  Screenshot included and saved as ERD_Diagram.

Step 2 - Data Engineering:  Tables have been created in Postgres to hold 6 csv files creating a table schema.  The csv files have also been imported into the database Tables.  The file was saved as table_schema.sql.

Step 3 - Data Analysis: Queries ran to answer the following questions below.  The query file was saved as query.sql.  A screenshot was also included of each individual question with screenshot of the query results.  These are saved as .png files in a folder called query_results.
